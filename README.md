# Road-Accident-Analysis

**Project Overview**

This project analyzes road accident data using Microsoft Excel to identify key trends, patterns, and risk factors that influence accident frequency and severity. The goal is to transform raw accident data into meaningful insights that support safety decisions and resource planning.

**Key Objectives**

Understand accident trends over time (daily/weekly/monthly patterns)

Identify high-risk locations, vehicle types, and accident causes

Analyze severity levels and contributing factors

Present findings in easy-to-read charts and dashboards

**Tools & Techniques Used (Excel Only)**

Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates

Handled missing values

Standardized date/time formats

Categorized accident types

Data Analysis

Pivot Tables for grouping & aggregating data

Pivot Charts for visual insights

Slicers & Filters for interactive exploration

**Dashboard Creation**

KPI tiles (Total Accidents, Fatal Cases, Minor Injuries)

Trend charts: line graphs showing accident frequency

Bar & Pie charts for vehicle type, location, cause distribution

Heat-maps for identifying high-risk periods

**Key Insights (Example – adjust based on your dataset)**

Peak accidents occur during evening hours and weekends

Two-wheelers have the highest involvement in accidents

Specific intersections or regions show consistently high accident rates

Seasonal variations indicate higher accidents during rainy months

**Outcome / Impact**

Converted raw accident records into actionable insights

Built an Excel dashboard for quick decision-making

Demonstrated strong analytical ability using only Excel

Showcased real-world data exploration aligned with Data Analyst roles
