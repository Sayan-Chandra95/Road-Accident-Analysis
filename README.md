**Road Accident Analysis — Excel Data Analytics Project**

**Project Summary**

This project transforms raw road-accident data into clear, actionable insights using Microsoft Excel.
It focuses on identifying accident patterns, high-risk zones, and key factors that influence accident severity—supporting data-driven safety decisions.

**Project Objectives**

Analyze accident trends across time (hourly, daily, monthly).

Identify high-risk locations, accident causes, and vehicle types.

Study severity levels (fatal, serious, minor injuries) and contributing factors.

Present insights through a clean, interactive Excel dashboard.

Demonstrate end-to-end data analysis using Excel only.
